      This is the map for all the Fast Travels on the map. Fast travels are instant
      teleporters to bring you around the map as soon as you unlock them. A common
      strategy is respawning multiple times in the beginning of the game at different
      respawn points to unlock a few distant fast travels right away. They can also be
      used to teleport to and back from your guild base.
