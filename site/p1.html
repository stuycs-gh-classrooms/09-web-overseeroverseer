      This is the map for the Pal Bosses Location Map around the map.
      Boss Pals, sometimes also called Alpha Pals, pals that have higher stat
      values than most other pals around the same area, often being multiple
      levels higher as well. Some alpha pals are the only way you can optain
      them, others are just larger versions of the same pal you can catch elsewhere
      on the map. They are great additions for your team and also drop ancient
      civilization parts which are needed to progress the ancient technology tree.
      Early game bosses like Chillet can easily carry you through the early game,
      while the 5 legendary pals like Paladius are boss pals that you unlock towards
      the end of the current update.
