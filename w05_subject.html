  <h2> Chests and Eggs Map </h2>

  <p>
    This is the map for the Chests and Eggs around the map.
    Chests are an easy source of resources early game or to unlock
    rare materials and schematics late game. Some might require a key.
    Eggs are the key to easily progress through the game. With an incubator
    you unlock many late game pals early on, without needing to wait until
    level 19 to unlock breeding.

  <h2> Pal Bosses Location Map</h2>
  <img src="Boss Pals.png" alt="Boss Pals Location Map">
  <p>
    This is the map for the Pal Bosses Location Map around the map.
    Boss Pals, sometimes also called Alpha Pals, pals that have higher stat
    values than most other pals around the same area, often being multiple
    levels higher as well. Some alpha pals are the only way you can optain
    them, others are just larger versions of the same pal you can catch elsewhere
    on the map. They are great additions for your team and also drop ancient
    civilization parts which are needed to progress the ancient technology tree.
    Early game bosses like Chillet can easily carry you through the early game,
    while the 5 legendary pals like Paladius are boss pals that you unlock towards
    the end of the current update.
  <p>
  <h2> Fast Travel Map </h2>
  <img src="Fast Travel.png" alt="Fast Travel Map">
  <p>
    This is the map for all the Fast Travels on the map. Fast travels are instant
    teleporters to bring you around the map as soon as you unlock them. A common
    strategy is respawning multiple times in the beginning of the game at different
    respawn points to unlock a few distant fast travels right away. They can also be
    used to teleport to and back from your guild base.
